Experiment on Katherin's Peapod :)

I've integrated several 2way comm features like notes/todos, ping my phone, volume control, Battery Status,
calendar with upcoming events/reminders. I'm working on the iPhone app to give it a good look n feel so
people can add notes and configure things, and also planning adding camera control and push2pebble reminders/notes
using wake function.Thanks to lot of guys whom source I found in github helped me a lot learning and copy-pasting :)
I will mention their names and convey my gratitude in my release post.
